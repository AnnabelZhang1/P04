qinaL -- 2022-05-31 19:15
- turn.js handles switching from each players turn to the next players
- next button no longer switches phase, it goes to next player, and when all players have gone is when turn phase changes
- emperors have a name property ("red") and a color property (red hexcode), easier to show who's turn on screen this way

qinaL -- 2022-06-01 8:56

- when click on your fort tile, delete fort button appears, button functionality works (will delete the fort)
- when click on your fort tile, buy troops button appears, button works and will buy 1 troop

qinaL -- 2022-06-04 20:12

sophieL -- 2022-06-04 21:56

qinaL -- 2022-06-04 22:04
- if your tile has troops on it, move troops button appears
- troop.js created for troop movement functions

- fixed adjacent tile code, and put into whereMoveTroops fxn in troop.js instead of in hexClick in canvas.js

qinaL -- 2022-06-06 18:24
- whereMoveTroops will call troopHighlight on all 6 adjacent tiles so adj tiles get gray highlight over hexs to visually indicate where troops can move
